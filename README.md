Hardening an Ubuntu server entails improving its security to reduce the potential risk of unauthorized access or malicious activities. The steps for hardening an Ubuntu 22.04 server will be similar to previous versions with some variations due to software updates and feature changes. Here's a general guide to help you harden your Ubuntu 22.04 server:

1. Update & Upgrade System Packages

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

2. Use Strong Passwords

- Ensure that all user passwords are strong, ideally using a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special symbols.
- Consider implementing a password policy.

3. Install and Configure a Firewall

- Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) is an easy-to-use interface for managing iptables.

```
sudo apt install ufw
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw enable
```

4. Disable Root Login

- Edit the SSH daemon configuration:

```
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

- Find the line PermitRootLogin and set it to no.
- Restart the SSH service:

```
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

5. Use SSH Key-based Authentication

- If you haven't already, generate an SSH key pair and transfer the public key to the server.
- Disable password-based SSH authentication by editing /etc/ssh/sshd_config and setting PasswordAuthentication to no.

6. Install Fail2Ban

- Fail2Ban scans logs and bans IP addresses that show malicious signs.

```
sudo apt install fail2ban
sudo systemctl enable fail2ban
sudo systemctl start fail2ban
```

7. Minimize Software

- Only install necessary software packages.
- Remove unnecessary packages:

```
sudo apt autoremove
```

8. Regularly Monitor System Logs

- Regularly check logs in /var/log/, especially auth.log, syslog, and application-specific logs.
  Configure Automatic Security Updates

9. Install the unattended-upgrades package:

```
sudo apt install unattended-upgrades
```

- Ensure that it's configured to automatically install security updates.

10. Limit sudo Privileges

- Only give sudo privileges to users who absolutely need them.
- Use the visudo command to edit the sudoers file.
